# grpc-todo
A small application made as a template for a basic Go based gRPC service with graceful termination.

The todo list just runs in memory. It's nothing complicated.

## Getting started

Refer to the `Makefile`:
```
â‡’  make help
help                           View help information
clean                          Clean any generated files
generate                       Generate protos and mocks
run_service                    Run the application in service mode
run_client                     Run the application in client mode
```
